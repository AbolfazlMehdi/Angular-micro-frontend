# Micro Frontend Architecture with Angular

This repository contains two Angular applications built using micro frontend architecture: host-app and remote-app. These applications demonstrate the principles of micro frontend development, including independent build processes, deployment, and communication between micro frontends.


# Introduction
Micro frontend architecture decomposes a front-end app into individual, independent "applications" that work loosely together. Each micro frontend has its own build process and deployment, facilitating a fast development cycle. In this repository, we explore how to implement micro frontends using Angular.
