# Remote App

# Step 1: 
Install the Module Federation Library


# ng add @angular-architects/module-federation@your-version(16.0.3) --project your app name(remote-app) --port 4201 --type remote


# Create a New Module for sharing:
 Generate a new module in your remote application to contain the components and services that you want to expose to other applications.

 # ng generate module your module name (pages) --routing

# Generate a New Component: 

Create a new component within the page module. This component will be part of the remote microfrontend and can be consumed by other applications.

# ng generate component pages/pages --module pages


# Configure Webpack for Module Federation: 
In the webpack.config.js file of your remote application (remot-app), configure module federation settings. This includes specifying the modules to be exposed to other applications.

# Configure Routing: 
Update the routing configuration of your remote microfrontend module (pagesModule) to define the routes for the components.
